# Quizzler

Developed a quiz app on IOS using Swift which asks the user several common knowledge questions and the user is graded immediately.
Incorporated the SVProgressHUD to enhance the design of the front-end of the applications.

Used Udemy's IOS App Development Bootcamp Course as a resource and template for the project.
